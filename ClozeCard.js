// * Create a new file named `ClozeCard.js`:

//   * This file should define a Node module that exports a constructor for creating cloze-deletion flashcards, e.g.:
//     `module.exports = ClozeCard;`

//   * The constructor should accept two arguments: `text` and `cloze`.

//   * The constructed object should have a `cloze` property that contains _only_ the cloze-deleted portion of the text.

//   * The constructed object should have a `partial` property that contains _only_ the partial text.

//   * The constructed object should have a `fullText` property that contains _only_ the full text.

//   * The constructor should throw or log an error when the cloze deletion does _not_ appear in the input text.

//   * Use prototypes to attach these methods, wherever possible.

// The bulk of this assignment is implementing `ClozeCard`. If you build a robust `ClozeCard` implementation, feel free to try your hand at implementing a front-end, as well.

// ### Examples

// Your constructors should work as follows.

// ```
// var firstPresident = new BasicCard(
//     "Who was the first president of the United States?", "George Washington");

// // "Who was the first president of the United States?"
// console.log(firstPresident.front); 

// // "George Washington"
// console.log(firstPresident.back); 

// var firstPresidentCloze = new ClozeCard(
//     "George Washington was the first president of the United States.", "George Washington");

// // "George Washington"
// console.log(firstPresidentCloze.cloze); 

// // " ... was the first president of the United States.
// console.log(firstPresidentCloze.partial); "

// // "George Washington was the first president of the United States.
// console.log(firstPresidentCloze.fullText): "

// // Should throw or log an error because "oops" doesn't appear in "This doesn't work"
// var brokenCloze = new ClozeCard("This doesn't work", "oops");
// ```

// ### Bonuses

// * Write your constructors such that users can call them with or without the `new` keyword. 

//   * Look up scope-safe constructors, and try to implement them. It takes only two additional lines of code.

function ClozeCard(answer, question) {
	var str = question;
	//allow for the search to be insensative to case and anwhere in context
	// var answer = '/' + answer + '/i';
	var newQuestion = str.replace(answer, '...');
	
	this.front = newQuestion;
	this.back = answer;
}
