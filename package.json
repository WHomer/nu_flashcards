  "description": "In this week's assignment, you will create the backend for a basic flashcard application.  The backend will essentially constitute an API that allows users to create two types of flashcards.  1. **Basic** flashcards, which have a front (_\"Who was the first president of the United States?\"_), and a back (_\"George Washington\"_).  2. **Cloze-Deleted** flashcards, which present _partial_ text (_\"... was the first president of the United States.\"_), and the full text when the user requests it (_\"George Washington was the first president of the United States.\"_)",
